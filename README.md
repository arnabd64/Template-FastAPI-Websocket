# Socket Chat

## Overview

This project provides a foundational framework for building a chat application backend using Websockets on FastAPI. Designed with simplicity at its core, the project offers:

* **FastAPI Integration**: Leverages the speed and efficiency of FastAPI for building APIs.

* **Websocket support**: Enables real-time, bidirectional communication between server and clients.

* **Robust Exception Handling**: Ensures smooth operation and graceful error management.

* **Docker and DevContainers**: Simplifies development and deployment with containerization.

This framework allows developers to quickly build and deploy a scalable chat application backend. The focus on simplicity makes it easy to understand and customize, while the robust exception handling ensures reliable operation. Additionally, Docker and DevContainers streamline the development and deployment process, making it accessible to a wider range of developers.

This project serves as a starting point for developers who want to build their own chat applications with minimal complexity. It provides the essential building blocks for real-time communication, allowing developers to focus on adding unique features and functionalities.
